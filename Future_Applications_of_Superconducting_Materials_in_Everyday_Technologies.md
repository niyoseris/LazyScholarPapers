The inherent characteristics of SMES, such as fast response times (on the order of milliseconds) and high power density, make them particularly well-suited for mitigating power quality issues and enhancing grid resilience.

This section provides an overview of SMES technology and its application in grid stabilization, based on a review of existing literature. The following discussion synthesizes information from various journal references pertaining to the design, operation, and performance of SMES systems. Given the nature of the reviewed material, the focus is on summarizing established knowledge and current applications, rather than identifying novel theoretical frameworks or research gaps.

SMES systems typically consist of three main components: the superconducting coil, the power conditioning system (PCS), and the cryogenic refrigeration system. The superconducting coil, often constructed from materials like niobium-titanium (NbTi) or high-temperature superconductors (HTS), is the core element responsible for energy storage. The PCS interfaces the SMES coil with the AC grid, converting AC power to DC for charging the coil and converting DC power back to AC for discharging. This component plays a crucial role in controlling the power flow and maintaining grid stability. The cryogenic refrigeration system is essential for maintaining the superconducting state of the coil, ensuring minimal energy losses due to resistance.

The application of SMES for grid stabilization encompasses a range of functionalities. These include frequency regulation, voltage support, and transient stability enhancement. Frequency regulation involves the rapid injection or absorption of power to maintain the grid frequency within acceptable limits, particularly in response to sudden load changes or generation outages. Voltage support entails providing reactive power to stabilize voltage levels and prevent voltage sags or swells. Transient stability enhancement utilizes SMES to quickly inject or absorb power during transient events, such as faults or disturbances, to prevent system instability and maintain synchronism. While the reviewed literature offers extensive coverage of these applications, a comprehensive identification of specific, unaddressed research gaps within this established field requires further investigation beyond the scope of this overview. The emphasis here is on presenting a consolidated understanding of SMES technology and its documented contributions to grid stabilization based on available journal references.

Superconducting energy storage represents a promising avenue for advanced battery technology, particularly in the pursuit of high-capacity energy storage solutions. While traditional batteries rely on chemical reactions to store and release energy, superconducting batteries leverage the unique properties of superconducting materials to achieve potentially higher energy densities and faster charge/discharge rates. This section explores the potential application of novel materials, specifically titanium oxide MOenes (Ti2O), within the context of superconducting energy storage, focusing on their viability as anode materials.

The exploration of Ti2O MOene as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries stems from its unique structural and electronic properties. Theoretical investigations indicate that single-layer di-titanium oxide Ti2O MOene exhibits exceptional thermal and dynamical stability, attributed to the strong ionic bonding interactions between titanium and oxygen atoms. This inherent stability is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the anode material during repeated charge-discharge cycles, a key factor in battery longevity.

Furthermore, Ti2O MOene is classified as an intrinsic electride. Electrides are characterized by electrons occupying anionic voids within the crystal lattice, behaving as quasi-free electrons. This electride nature contributes to the material's enhanced electronic conductivity, a desirable attribute for anode materials as it facilitates efficient electron transport during electrochemical reactions.

Critically, theoretical calculations reveal exceptionally low diffusion barriers for lithium and sodium ions on the Ti2O MOene surface. Specifically, the diffusion barriers are reported to be approximately 12.0 meV for Li+ and 6.3 meV for Na+ diffusion, respectively. These remarkably low barriers suggest facile ion transport kinetics, implying that Ti2O MOene anodes could potentially enable rapid charging and discharging capabilities in lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. This rapid ion transport is vital for achieving high power density in energy storage devices. The combined properties of high stability, electride nature, and low diffusion barriers suggest that Ti2O MOene warrants further investigation as a potential component in advanced battery technologies, potentially contributing to the development of high-capacity superconducting batteries.
