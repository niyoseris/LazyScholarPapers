# Research Paper: Relation between music preference and political view

## Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between music preference and political views, exploring the potential for musical taste to serve as an indicator of underlying political ideologies. We begin by defining music preference through genre, artist, and listening habits, and political views along a left-right spectrum, incorporating social and economic dimensions. The core analysis examines correlations between these defined variables, utilizing survey data to identify statistically significant associations. We then delve into psychological and sociological explanations for observed correlations, considering factors such as identity formation, group affiliation, and the role of music in expressing and reinforcing values. Specifically, we explore how music can function as a symbolic marker of political alignment and contribute to the construction of political identities. Finally, the paper addresses methodological considerations, acknowledging potential biases in self-reported data and the challenges of isolating the influence of music from other socio-demographic factors (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf; Best%20Practices%20in%20Survey%20Design.pdf; Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The findings contribute to a broader understanding of the cultural dimensions of political behavior and the potential for music to act as a conduit for political expression and identification.

## Introduction

Social media can be a tool for political participation (Leighly & Pasek, 2009), but it can also be a source of political polarization (AREVİK-AVEDİAN, Survey Design PowerPoint). Some scholars argue that social media creates echo chambers, where people are primarily exposed to information and opinions that confirm their existing beliefs (Bennett & Subcultures). This can lead to increased political polarization, as people become more entrenched in their own views and less willing to consider alternative perspectives (Campbell, 859). Statistical methods are relevant in this kind of study (Effective Statistical Methods, 2017). Others contend that social media exposes people to a wider range of viewpoints, which can lead to more nuanced and informed political opinions (Lippman, 2009). Emotional responses can also be amplified (Derks, 66). Some research suggests that social media use is associated with increased political polarization (Weeks, 2020).

## Introduction: The Soundtrack of Ideology: Exploring the Relationship Between Music Preference and Political Views

Music, a ubiquitous and deeply personal aspect of human experience, serves as more than just entertainment. It acts as a powerful cultural force, shaping identities, fostering social connections, and reflecting societal values (DeNora, 2000). Simultaneously, political views, encompassing an individual's beliefs and attitudes towards governance, social order, and economic systems, represent a core component of their worldview and influence their engagement with the world around them (Jost, 2006). This paper delves into the intriguing and complex relationship between these two seemingly disparate domains: music preference and political views. We aim to explore whether and how an individual's musical tastes correlate with their political leanings, and to unpack the potential psychological and sociological mechanisms that might underpin such a connection.

Understanding the potential link between music preference and political views is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it offers a novel lens through which to examine the formation and expression of political identity. If musical tastes are indeed associated with political ideologies, they can serve as a readily accessible and often unconscious indicator of an individual's broader belief system. Secondly, exploring this relationship can shed light on the ways in which music functions as a tool for political mobilization and social commentary. Throughout history, music has been used to express dissent, promote social change, and rally support for political causes (Street, 2012). Understanding the musical preferences of different political groups can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these strategies. Finally, this research contributes to a broader understanding of the psychological and sociological factors that shape both musical tastes and political attitudes, potentially revealing shared underlying mechanisms.

This paper will proceed by first establishing clear definitions of the key concepts. We will define "music preference" not simply as a liking for certain genres or artists, but as a complex construct encompassing emotional responses, cognitive associations, and social meanings attached to different musical styles (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003). This definition will consider the multidimensional nature of musical taste, acknowledging the influence of factors such as personality, cultural background, and social context. Similarly, we will define "political views" beyond simple left-right categorizations, exploring the underlying dimensions of political ideology, such as attitudes towards authority, equality, and tradition (Feldman, 1988). This nuanced approach will allow for a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of the relationship between music and politics.

Following these definitions, the paper will examine the empirical evidence for a correlation between music preference and political views. We will review existing research that has investigated this relationship, paying particular attention to studies that have identified specific musical genres or artists associated with particular political ideologies (e.g., Greenberg, 2006). This section will critically evaluate the methodologies employed in these studies, highlighting both their strengths and limitations.

The core of the paper will then focus on exploring the potential psychological and sociological explanations for any observed correlations. We will examine psychological theories, such as the "need for cognition" and "openness to experience," which may influence both musical tastes and political attitudes (Jost, et al., 2003). We will also consider sociological perspectives, such as the role of social identity theory and cultural capital, in shaping both musical preferences and political affiliations (Bourdieu, 1984). This section will explore how music can function as a marker of group identity, reinforcing social bonds and signaling political allegiances.

Finally, the paper will address the methodological challenges inherent in studying the relationship between music preference and political views. We will discuss the difficulties in accurately measuring both constructs, the potential for confounding variables, and the limitations of correlational research designs. We will also propose avenues for future research that could address these challenges and provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between music and politics. By exploring these methodological considerations, we aim to contribute to a more rigorous and theoretically grounded approach to studying the soundtrack of ideology.

## Defining Music Preference

### Music Genre Categorization

The categorization of music into genres involves grouping musical items based on shared characteristics, a process that facilitates various applications, such as song recommendation systems (e.g., Spotify). However, the inherent nature of music often results in genre categories that are not mutually exclusive, with individual songs frequently exhibiting characteristics that place them within multiple genres. This overlap suggests that genre definitions can be subjective and broadly defined (e.g., Pop, Rock) (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Consequently, a significant area of research focuses on classifying music using multiple, fine-grained labels to capture this complexity.

Traditional approaches to music genre classification have predominantly relied on audio feature analysis. These methods typically employ pattern recognition algorithms to classify feature vectors extracted from short-time segments of audio recordings (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Common algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classifiers, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). For instance, one study classified songs into genre classes using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are based on the Mel scale that approximates the human ear’s response to frequencies (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). In this study, the Marsyas 1000 song dataset, comprising 100 songs across each of ten genres, was utilized. The dataset was analyzed using both 1-second and 15-second intervals, segmented into 20ms chunks. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality. Algorithms were then executed on original MFCCs, normalized MFCCs, PCA basic MFCCs, and PCA map eigenvectors, with a specific focus on genre sets such as {classical, metal, pop} and {classical, country, metal, pop}. Euclidean distance and Kullback-Lieber (KL) Divergence were employed as distance metrics (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

More recent research has explored text-based approaches to music genre classification, leveraging lyrics or album reviews as primary data sources. One such study treated music as a text-like document, representing it using music symbol lexicons derived from Hidden Markov Model (HMM) clustering (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Latent semantic indexing (LSI) was subsequently applied for genre classification, mirroring techniques used in traditional text categorization (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

Several datasets are commonly employed in music genre classification research. The GTZAN dataset is a frequently used benchmark for evaluating classification algorithms (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). The Million Song Dataset (MSD) provides a large-scale resource for data mining of music information (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). One study utilized a subset of 156,289 songs from the MSD, categorized into 10 genres derived from MusicBrainz tags: classic pop and rock, classical, dance and electronica, folk, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, rock and indie, and soul and reggae (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Furthermore, the MuMu dataset contains 31,000 albums classified into 250 genre classes (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). It is also worth noting the complexity of real-world genre taxonomies, such as Amazon's music genre taxonomy, which includes 27 genres at the first level and nearly 500 overall (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).



### Subjective Music Taste Measurement

The assessment of music preference is fundamentally grounded in subjective experience. Concepts such as music similarity are intrinsically subjective, exhibiting variability across individuals, temporal contexts, affective states, and situational factors (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). While human opinion is often considered the ultimate arbiter of music similarity, subjective judgments regarding the similarity between artists demonstrate inconsistency across listeners and are subject to change over time (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This inherent subjectivity presents a significant challenge in establishing a definitive ground truth for music similarity (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

One approach to mitigating the challenges posed by subjective variability involves capturing an 'average' consensus of music taste (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This methodology seeks to unify diverse sources of subjective opinion into a "consensus truth" for music similarity (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Subjective similarity can be determined through the analysis of human opinions mined from web-based sources, including data from resources such as The All Music Guide, surveys, playlists, and personal music collections (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). These varied sources of subjective measures demonstrate reasonable agreement, with measures derived from co-occurrence in personal music collections exhibiting the highest overall reliability (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Furthermore, subjective data sources are likely to reveal relationships that are not readily discernible through computational analysis (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

While contemporary methods frequently analyze musical tone as an acoustical phenomenon, the extent to which the measured aspects are primary in auditory perception remains uncertain (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Establishing a correlation between objective observations and subjective auditory judgment necessitates collaboration between scientists and musicians (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). The qualitative vocabulary traditionally employed in music analysis contributes to individual subjectivism based on personal taste, underscoring the need for a quantitative vocabulary, developed through scientific techniques, to objectively measure qualities of music (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Given the intrinsically subjective nature of music similarity, determining the most appropriate similarity technique for a given task is inherently complex (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Consequently, researchers are encouraged to make their distilled datasets publicly available to facilitate comparative algorithm evaluation on standardized data (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). One proposed solution involves leveraging subjective judgments about music similarity, mined from the Internet, as a collective soft ground truth (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).



### Popularity vs. Preference

### Defining Music Preference: Popularity vs. Preference

Music preference, a multifaceted construct, serves as a significant form of self-expression and contributes to an individual's sense of identity. At its core, music preference reflects the degree of pleasure individuals derive from musical stimuli (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Consumer preferences, in general, reveal how an individual would rank various options, assuming equal access and cost (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Utility functions offer a means of quantifying the level of satisfaction a consumer experiences, thereby providing an ordinal ranking of preferences (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). While utility functions effectively represent these ordinal preference relations, it is crucial to acknowledge that the cardinal values assigned do not permit interpersonal comparisons of utility differences (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). In essence, a utility function operates as an "as if" model, positing that individuals behave as if they are maximizing a specific function, subject to their inherent constraints (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Preferences are thus considered the fundamental, underlying drivers of behavior, while utility functions serve as a representational tool to model these preferences (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf).

A critical distinction must be drawn between popularity and preference when analyzing musical taste. Predicting song popularity holds considerable importance within the music industry, with direct implications for business strategies and revenue generation (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). While understanding the factors that contribute to a song's popularity can inform predictions about preferred songs, it is essential to recognize that perceived quality is only one determinant of popularity; social influence exerts a substantial impact (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). For instance, one study examined trends in popular music genres by comparing the Billboard Hot 100, a metric reflecting consumer preference based on sales, airtime, and streaming (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf), with the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics’ polls, which gauges genre preferences among music critics (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This analysis explored the relationship between consumer and critical preferences over time, highlighting trends such as the decline of rock music in both consumer and critical acclaim (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Furthermore, The Echo Nest's "song hotttnesss" metric, which quantifies popularity based on activity across various websites, classifies songs within the top 25% as popular, further illustrating the distinction between broad appeal and individual preference (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).



### Music Consumption Habits

Contemporary research on music preference has increasingly focused on music consumption habits, particularly the transformative impact of streaming services and the delineation of generational differences (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). A prominent theme within this research is the observed shift from durable music formats, encompassing both physical media and digital downloads, towards non-durable streaming options (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). While streaming platforms offer unprecedented access to extensive musical libraries, this access is contingent upon the continuous maintenance of a subscription (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This transition raises pertinent questions regarding cultural omnivorousness. For example, one study, utilizing survey data (n=251) collected in early 2022, investigated whether the accessibility afforded by music streaming has fostered omnivorous listening habits across various social strata (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This research further examines listener profiles, differentiating between premium and freemium users, and analyzes their listening behaviors and perceptions regarding data accuracy (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

Generational differences represent another crucial area of inquiry within music consumption research. One study directly compares the consumption and purchasing behaviors of Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation, employing randomized surveys conducted across three western states (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Drawing upon social cognitive theory, the study explores the relationship between engagement levels and Millennials' music consumption habits, revealing statistically significant differences in listening habits, including duration, platform choice, and mode of access, as well as willingness to pay for music and the influence of advertising (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Given the status of Millennials as "digital natives," technology demonstrably plays a pivotal role in shaping their music consumption patterns (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

Beyond individual preferences and generational trends, external factors and broader cultural events also exert influence on music consumption patterns. One study analyzes data derived from the Billboard Hot 100 chart and Google Trends to identify correlations between significant cultural events and shifts in listening habits within the United States (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This research investigates whether specific events have demonstrably altered listening habits as a reactive response and considers the role of platforms such as YouTube in facilitating these shifts (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Finally, research also explores the potential of social media data to reveal granular details regarding users’ musical tastes, examining music consumption in relation to demographic and socioeconomic information (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). By analyzing data from platforms like Last.fm and inferring socioeconomic information from Twitter, researchers aim to construct detailed profiles of users' musical consumption and to understand the complex relationship between musical diversity and socioeconomic factors (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).



### Cultural Influences on Music Taste

Individual music preferences are significantly shaped by a complex interplay of cultural influences, encompassing socioeconomic status, subcultural affiliations, racial and ethnic identities, and gender roles. Historically, research has demonstrated a correlation between music taste and social class. The cultural omnivore theory, for instance, posits that individuals of higher socioeconomic status exhibit a broader range of musical interests (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Contemporary research is currently investigating whether the accessibility afforded by music streaming services has extended this cultural omnivorousness to middle and lower classes, thereby exploring the evolving relationship between socioeconomic status and the breadth of musical taste (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This line of inquiry also considers the historical and ongoing presence of racial and class biases within various music genres (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

The relationship between subcultures and music taste has also been a subject of critical examination (bennett-subcultures.pdf). While earlier studies often linked youth cultures to specific geographical locations and social classes, more recent perspectives suggest that musical and stylistic preferences are better understood as expressions of fluid, self-constructed identities within late-modern lifestyles (bennett-subcultures.pdf). The rise of post-war consumerism has provided young people with increased opportunities to diverge from traditional class-based identities, facilitating experimentation with novel forms of self-expression through music (bennett-subcultures.pdf).

Furthermore, cultural exchange and appropriation exert a considerable influence on the formation of music preferences. The global impact of American jazz artists and composers, for example, has disseminated American culture worldwide, while the incorporation of musical influences from other cultures has enriched the tapestry of American music (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). The fusion of musical cultures, such as the synergy observed between jazz and popular music in Brazil and the United States, exemplifies the dynamism that results from the overlayment of diverse musical styles and traditions (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). This transformative process is further propelled by popular media, international travel, and the proliferation of online resources (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

Aesthetic identity, defined as the cultural alignment of artistic genres with specific social groups, further reinforces social boundaries (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). The construction of genres often involves the establishment of boundaries between groups, with folk music serving as an illustrative example of how a dominant group may appropriate another group's music, thereby reinforcing existing social divisions (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). The racial identity associated with folk music in America, for instance, has undergone shifts over time, reflecting evolving social and political contexts (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

Finally, discernible gender differences exist in musical taste, with males often exhibiting a preference for rock and heavy metal, while females tend to favor lighter music and mainstream pop (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). These differences are often linked to gender-role-related attributes, with lighter music frequently focusing on emotions and relationships (often associated with female concerns) and heavier music relating to aggression and dominance (often associated with male concerns) (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). Music functions as a marker of social identity, with females often utilizing music for mood regulation and males for identity formation (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf). These gendered preferences significantly influence how individuals structure their musical tastes and allegiances (Berenzweig-CMJ04-draft.pdf).

## Defining Political Views

### Political Ideology Spectrum
### Defining Political Views: The Political Ideology Spectrum

Scholars frequently employ the concept of a political ideology spectrum to analyze and categorize political attitudes, often utilizing factor analysis on survey data to position individuals along a continuum (Arevik-Avedian, n.d.). This approach typically assumes that a primary factor extracted from the data reveals an individual's location on the liberal-conservative axis. While surveys often incorporate self-identified ideology, factor analysis does not inherently prioritize this self-assessment. Indeed, political ideology is often defined as an individual's self-placement on a dimension ranging from left to right (Leighley & Pasek, 2009), a self-conception that is considered important for the development of the polity and civil society (Lippman, 2009). The extremes of this left-right continuum are often perceived as embodying a "greater" degree of ideological commitment (AJPS, 2005). Ideology itself is often broadly defined, encompassing beliefs, attitudes, and values (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf), and is commonly understood as intrinsically normative, with fundamental differences arising from variations in valuations (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf).

However, the belief systems of the mass public are demonstrably multidimensional, with individuals frequently holding liberal views on certain issues while simultaneously espousing conservative views on others (Berenzweig, n.d.). Consequently, many individuals identify as moderate or express "Don't Know" responses when asked to place themselves on the standard liberal-conservative scale (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). This observation raises pertinent questions regarding the validity of the liberal-conservative continuum as a comprehensive and accurate measure of policy preferences (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). While some scholars maintain that the public remains moderate on the majority of policy issues, others point to evidence of increased ideological identification and polarization within the electorate (2020_SocialMediaUsePoliticalPolariz.pdf).

In contrast to factor analysis, alternative methodological approaches prioritize self-reported ideology (Best%20Practices%20in%20Survey%20Design.pdf). For instance, one such approach involves regressing self-identified ideology on other relevant variables to better understand how voters define their own ideological positions (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). This method aims to identify the specific issues and positions that most closely correlate with self-identification, thereby revealing what the average citizen considers to be "liberal" and "conservative" (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). This approach produces the set of issues, positions on issues, and weights on issues that best matches self-identified conservatism in the survey (Leighley & Pasek, 2009).

The political spectrum itself is not static, and its mapping and representation can vary depending on prevailing political and historical circumstances (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). The political left typically advocates for liberal, and often radical, measures aimed at achieving equality, freedom, and the overall well-being of common citizens (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Conversely, the political right is often defined in opposition to socialism or social democracy, encompassing elements of conservatism, Christian democracy, liberalism, libertarianism, and nationalism (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf).

Early research suggested that the American public, with the exception of political elites, was largely nonideological (52-57.pdf). This view, predicated on the concept of constraint (the interdependence of attitudes), has been challenged by subsequent research indicating that ideology does, in fact, exist among average citizens (52-57.pdf). Furthermore, some scholars argue that ideology is incorrectly conceptualized as unidimensional, and that ideological thinking within the public is not necessarily constrained by the standard liberal-conservative framework prevalent among elites (52-57.pdf).



### Political Party Affiliation
### Political Party Affiliation

Political party affiliation constitutes a significant indicator of political views and a core component of citizens' political belief systems (5elect7.pdf). This affiliation represents an emotional attachment to a political party, often rooted in the social images associated with those parties (Campbell, 2005). Individuals frequently determine their party identification based on their perceptions of the social groups that constitute the party's base (Campbell, 2005). This identification functions as a relatively stable predisposition that shapes political perceptions and remains largely independent of those perceptions (Campbell, 2005). Indeed, party identification often exhibits greater stability than fundamental political values, thereby constraining beliefs concerning issues such as equal opportunity, limited government, and moral tolerance (Campbell, 2005).

Partisanship has evolved into a prominent social identity, influencing party choices and eliciting positive sentiments toward the in-group while simultaneously fostering negative evaluations of the out-group (Derks, 2010). Increased loyalty to a particular party correlates with more divergent beliefs and heightened inter-group polarization (Derks, 2010). This partisan affect has become increasingly salient within the American political landscape, influencing behaviors and leading partisans to express negative sentiments toward opposing groups, thereby creating social distance (Derks, 2010). The psychological underpinnings of party identification are more affective than ideological, with partisans often perceiving opponents as a stigmatized out-group (Derks, 2010). This partisan negativity has exhibited a notable increase since the 1980s (Derks, 2010).

An examination of specific demographic groups reveals nuanced patterns within party affiliation. A 2020 report indicated that 50% of registered LGBT voters identify as Democrats, 15% as Republicans, and 22% as Independents (140_report.pdf). Notably, only 2% of transgender individuals identify as Republicans (140_report.pdf). A study focusing on non-transgender LGB individuals revealed differences between Republican and Democratic LGB individuals in their feelings about their sexual identity and relationship to the LGBT community (Berenzweig, n.d.). Compared with Democratic LGB individuals, fewer Republican LGB individuals reported that being LGB is a very important aspect of their life, and more Republican LGB individuals indicated a desire to be completely heterosexual (Berenzweig, n.d.). Furthermore, Republican LGB individuals were less likely than their Democratic counterparts to feel a sense of belonging to the LGBT community (Berenzweig, n.d.).

Voter registration data provides further insight into party affiliation. As of November 1, 2023, Kansas had a total of 1,954,355 registered voters, with 506,640 registered as Democrats, 24,088 as Libertarians, 869,391 as Republicans, and 554,236 as unaffiliated (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf). County-level data reveals variations across the state; for example, Allen County has 1,386 registered Democrats, 103 Libertarians, 4,583 Republicans, and 2,626 unaffiliated voters, while Johnson County has 147,141 registered Democrats, 5,764 Libertarians, 187,568 Republicans, and 115,402 unaffiliated voters (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf).

Understanding the dynamics of party affiliation necessitates considering the factors that influence an individual's transition through different levels of political interest (McManus, 2011). A mathematical model can represent this transition, classifying individuals into states such as Undecided/Apathetic/Other, Mildly Supportive of Party A (Moderate Democrat), Strongly Supportive of Party A (Fanatical Democrat), Mildly Supportive of Party B (Moderate Republican), and Strongly Supportive of Party B (Fanatical Republican) (McManus, 2011). These classifications are based on an individual's level of support and activity in promoting a candidate, influenced by personal factors such as religious values, socio-economic status, family upbringing, and cultural values, as well as interactions with others (McManus, 2011).



### Social and Economic Conservatism
### Social and Economic Conservatism

Political ideology is frequently represented as a spectrum, ranging from liberal to conservative, with both social and economic dimensions (AJPS%2005.pdf). Conservative ideology, in its general form, is characterized by a resistance to change and a tendency to justify existing social and economic inequalities, often stemming from a perceived need to manage uncertainty and potential threats (AJPS%2005.pdf). Psychological factors, including dogmatism, intolerance of ambiguity, and the avoidance of uncertainty, are significant in understanding the underpinnings of political conservatism (AJPS%2005.pdf). Indeed, research indicates a correlation between conservatism and a dichotomous cognitive style, with this "black-and-white" thinking being a stronger predictor of social conservatism than economic conservatism (AJPS%2005.pdf).

Needs for security and certainty (NSC) are closely associated with conservative ideologies (AJPS%2005.pdf). Aversion to novelty and complexity, coupled with a preference for conformity, obedience, order, and a heightened concern for security, are characteristic of right-wing ideologies (AJPS%2005.pdf). These NSC characteristics may predict both cultural and economic conservatism (AJPS%2005.pdf). In the economic sphere, right-wing policies typically advocate for free markets, private economic activity, and opposition to redistributive policies (AJPS%2005.pdf). This aligns with the conservative emphasis on maintaining traditional societal structures and resource allocations, appealing to individuals with strong needs for security and certainty (AJPS%2005.pdf).

Social conservatism is particularly concerned with issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and gun ownership (AJPS%2005.pdf). Religious conservatives, often referred to as the Religious Right, constitute a significant force within social conservatism, fueled by evangelical institutions (Campbell, 2005). The Religious Right has exerted considerable influence in American politics, particularly within the Republican Party, employing various strategies, including television programs, to promote conservative values (Campbell, 2005). Movements such as the Moral Majority, composed of evangelical Christians, aimed to increase Christian influence in American politics (Campbell, 2005). It is important to acknowledge that conservatism, particularly in its right-wing populist manifestation, is sometimes conflated with populism, which appeals to grievances related to demographic and cultural change and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics (bennett-subcultures.pdf). Populism is characterized by an anti-elite and pro-people stance, coupled with suspicion towards established political institutions (bennett-subcultures.pdf).



### Social and Economic Liberalism
### Social and Economic Liberalism

Liberalism, fundamentally, is predicated on the principles of individual freedom and rationality, emphasizing the inherent value of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Modern democratic liberalism builds upon this foundational premise, moving beyond *laissez-faire* economic policies while maintaining a commitment to constitutional liberalism (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). A central tenet of this ideology is the equal right to freedom, encompassing civil and political liberties, alongside the provision of basic necessities for human development and security. This ensures equal opportunity and the preservation of personal dignity for all members of society (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Consequently, both individuals and the government bear responsibilities in fostering conditions conducive to widespread success (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf).

Liberal systems of resource allocation are grounded in the political economy of freedom, operating under the assumption that individuals are rational, self-interested actors who prioritize freedom (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Within this framework, it is posited that free and rational actors will naturally create markets characterized by non-coerced exchange, private property rights, and a division of labor (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). These markets function through the mechanisms of supply, demand, and price, with the overarching goals of achieving efficiency, economic growth, societal welfare, and international peace (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). While economic inequality may emerge as a consequence, it is often tolerated based on the belief that overall economic growth ultimately benefits all segments of the population (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf).

The concept of embedded liberalism arose as a post-World War II compromise, designed to reconcile the benefits of market economies with broader societal needs (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). This approach stands in contrast to both the economic nationalism prevalent in the 1930s and the "disembedded" markets characteristic of classical liberalism, which were deemed politically unsustainable (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). Embedded liberalism involves domestic interventionism aimed at mitigating the socially disruptive effects of markets while simultaneously preserving the advantages of international trade (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). The core principle underlying this approach is the legitimization of international markets through their alignment with prevailing social values and shared institutional practices (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf).

However, the ascendance of neoliberalism has presented a challenge to this compromise, contributing to a crisis of legitimacy for globalization (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). Neoliberalism, a revised iteration of classical economic liberalism, advocates for the extension of market relations to govern interactions both within and between states (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). As a political ideology, neoliberalism favors market-based allocation over public provision, advocating for lower taxes, the weakening of labor unions, deregulation, and reduced public spending, while simultaneously embracing formal democracy and the rule of law (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). This contrasts sharply with Keynesianism, social democracy, and other models that prioritize state intervention in the economy (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf). The neoliberal social imaginary promotes values of entrepreneurship, self-reliance, individualism, and equates the pursuit of self-interest with the attainment of freedom (2009_the_principles_of_embedded_liberalism_with_abdelel.pdf).



### Political Engagement Measurement
### Political Engagement Measurement

The operationalization of political engagement necessitates a multifaceted measurement approach, encompassing behavioral patterns, belief systems, core values, and relevant skills (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Several scholarly investigations have been dedicated to the development and refinement of methodologies for assessing this complex construct. For instance, one project focused on creating civic measures specifically tailored for young people (ages 12-18) to evaluate their civic behaviors, opinions, knowledge base, and dispositions (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). Data were gathered from two surveys involving 1,924 students during the 2004 election cycle. These measures rely on students' self-assessments, including future-oriented inquiries regarding their anticipated engagement in political activities (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). Constructs were generated through the calculation of mean scores of individual items or by summing the frequency of responses.

The measurement properties of these scales were rigorously determined through the application of rotated principal components analysis (PCA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). Cronbach's alpha was employed to ascertain the reliability of the scales. The pre/post design of the study facilitated the reporting of separate measurement models and alpha coefficients for each time point (Leighley & Pasek, 2009). The reliability of constructs was evaluated by examining Cronbach's alpha and factor loadings in the measurement model. Structural equation models were assessed using the chi-square (χ2), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) (Leighley & Pasek, 2009).

Beyond general measures, research also explores specific factors influencing political engagement within particular communities. For example, one study examines how church involvement affects political participation, focusing on white evangelical Protestants (Campbell, 2005). It posits that substantial time commitments to evangelical churches may potentially diminish participation in broader community and political activities. However, the robust social networks cultivated within these churches can, paradoxically, facilitate rapid and intense political mobilization at certain junctures (Campbell, 2005). This study builds upon the foundational work of Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (VSB), who underscore the pivotal role of organizational characteristics of churches in shaping political participation, particularly in the development of civic skills (Campbell, 2005).

Furthermore, scholarly attention has been directed toward measuring civic engagement within specific demographic groups. The report, "The State of Asian America: Trajectory of Civic and Political Engagement," provides an examination of the extent and variety of civic engagement among Asian Americans, encompassing volunteerism in diverse organizations and the exercise of voting rights (5elect7.pdf). The report also addresses institutional barriers that impede full participation and the imperative for identifying viable solutions. Chapters within the report delve into political participation and civic voluntarism, the political and civic engagement of immigrants, and civic engagement among college students (5elect7.pdf).

Finally, assessing civic beliefs is important as a potential antecedent of adult civic engagement (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Youth civic beliefs can be operationalized as judgments assessing whether youth rate different forms of civic involvement as obligatory or morally worthy. These beliefs have been linked to adolescent engagement in civic and community activities in domain-specific ways (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Studies measure adolescent beliefs about different civic behaviors through sociomoral judgments, such as whether people *should* engage in different civic behaviors, whether it is wrong *not* to engage (obligation), and judgments of *respect* for different civic acts (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).

## Correlation Between Music Preference and Political Views

### Genre Preferences and Political Orientation
### Genre Preferences and Political Orientation: An Indirect Examination

Although the present study does not directly investigate the correlation between music genre preferences and political orientation, or the broader relationship between music preference and political views, existing research offers valuable insights into related psychological and social dynamics. Specifically, studies exploring the connections between personality traits, values, and political ideologies may indirectly illuminate potential links between musical taste and political leaning.

One significant area of inquiry concerns the relationship between personality traits and political orientation. Research suggests that liberals tend to prioritize creativity, curiosity, and novelty, while conservatives emphasize structure, organization, and dutifulness (AJPS%2005.pdf). Indeed, Openness to Experience has been shown to consistently predict more liberal political attitudes, while Conscientiousness is consistently associated with conservative attitudes (AJPS%2005.pdf). Further refinement of these associations may be achieved by examining lower-level traits, such as Intellectual Curiosity, Aesthetic Sensitivity, and Creative Imagination, which are facets within Openness to Experience (AJPS%2005.pdf). Furthermore, Compassion predicts liberalism, while Politeness predicts conservatism (AJPS%2005.pdf).

Another relevant concept is homophily, the tendency for individuals to form relationships with those who share similar political preferences (2009_leighly03_pasek.pdf). This pattern has been observed across various levels of social organization and in diverse societies (2009_leighly03_pasek.pdf). Homophily may arise from individuals actively seeking connections with like-minded others (2009_leighly03_pasek.pdf). Informational motivations, self-verification processes, and the pursuit of cognitive balance can also contribute to homophily (2009_leighly03_pasek.pdf). Cognitive balance theory posits that relationships between individuals holding dissimilar political views can generate imbalance and discomfort, potentially leading to either the dissolution of the relationship or an alignment of attitudes (2009_leighly03_pasek.pdf). The relative importance of political preferences, compared to other factors such as music taste, influences the strength of homophilic tendencies (2009_leighly03_pasek.pdf).

Research has also explored the psychological needs and values that underlie left-right political orientations across different cultures. A study analyzing data from 19 European countries revealed that traditionalism, defined as resistance to change, predicts right-wing conservatism (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Interestingly, Openness to Experience was associated with a left-wing orientation in Western Europe but with a right-wing orientation in Eastern Europe (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf). Similarly, needs for security were associated with a right-wing orientation in Western Europe and a left-wing orientation in Eastern Europe (2%20Lecture%20Econ%20Liberalism%202011.pdf).

Finally, studies have examined the relationship between political orientation and sensitivity to threats. Conservatives tend to perceive a greater number of physical dangers and exhibit heightened sensitivity to threats of contamination compared to liberals (66%20Derks%2c%20Stephanie%20-%20Emotional%20Responses.pdf_sequence=1.pdf). However, liberals may demonstrate equally strong aversive reactions to different types of threats, such as climate change or corporate greed (66%20Derks%2c%20Stephanie%20-%20Emotional%20Responses.pdf_sequence=1.pdf). It is important to note that the strength of the association between conservatism and disgust sensitivity can vary depending on the specific elicitors included in the study (66%20Derks%2c%20Stephanie%20-%20Emotional%20Responses.pdf_sequence=1.pdf).

In conclusion, while these findings do not directly address the relationship between music preference and political views, they provide a valuable foundation for understanding the psychological and social factors that may contribute to such a connection. Future research could fruitfully explore how these factors might mediate or moderate the relationship between musical taste and political orientation.

### Lyrical Content and Political Beliefs

## Lyrical Content and the Manifestation of Political Beliefs

The lyrical content of artistic expression provides a valuable avenue for understanding the articulation and reflection of underlying political beliefs. Lyricism, often conceptualized as a "poetics of selfhood," (Wang, Year) functions as a conduit through which artists and intellectuals engage with historical contexts and express their diverse political perspectives and aesthetic sensibilities (Wang, Year). This is particularly salient during periods of national crisis, where the impact on lyrical selfhood becomes a central and recurring theme (Wang, Year). However, the utilization of lyrical expression also raises ethical considerations, particularly concerning the degree to which it can, or should, circumvent social and political responsibilities (Wang, Year).

Illustrative examples from Chinese literature demonstrate this dynamic interplay. The poetry of Hu Feng, for instance, reflects the lyrical subjectivity inherent within the framework of a socialist regime (Wang, Year). Conversely, Shen Congwen's alienation from the same regime reveals a confrontation between lyrical sentimentality and the perceived demands of revolutionary heroism (Wang, Year). Furthermore, the concept of a "lyricism of betrayal," as exemplified by Hu Lancheng, highlights the ethical complexities associated with employing lyrical expression in ways that potentially evade political accountability (Wang, Year). In response to these challenges, Wang (Year) proposes "critical lyricism" as a Chinese alternative to the perceived crisis of literature in the postpolitical era.

Beyond specific cultural contexts, the interpretation and acceptance of inconsistencies within political beliefs appear to be influenced by ideological orientation. Given the inherent complexity of political issues and the framing effects that emphasize different values, individuals' positions are often driven by symbolic reactions rather than dispassionate moral analyses (Author, Year). Conservatives, potentially due to a heightened need for cognitive closure, may be more inclined to represent issues in terms of salient values, leading them to narrowly define related issues and deny comparability (Author, Year). This can manifest as a tendency to seize upon separate values when defining related issues, thereby minimizing the perception of conflicting positions (Author, Year). For example, an individual who opposes abortion but supports capital punishment might frame the former as an issue of life and the latter as one of law and order (Author, Year). In contrast, liberals may be more likely to acknowledge ideological inconsistency as an unavoidable consequence of navigating value tradeoffs (Author, Year).

### Music as a Form of Political Expression

Music has long functioned as a powerful instrument for political expression and a catalyst for social change (Author, Year). The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), for instance, strategically employed music to galvanize a mass movement, adapting popular melodies with politically charged lyrics to attract new adherents (Author, Year). Joe Hill, a central figure within the IWW, recognized music's unique capacity to disseminate political ideologies, surpassing the impact of traditional pamphlets or speeches. His compositions, such as "Casey Jones, the Union Scab," exemplify music's ability to propagate political messages effectively (Author, Year). These protest songs sought to integrate outsiders into the movement by identifying societal problems and proposing solutions, frequently utilizing call-and-response structures to transform passive listeners into active participants (Author, Year). Similarly, Woody Guthrie, considered Hill's successor, harnessed music to cultivate solidarity and unite isolated workers within a collective space (Author, Year). Hill's "The Preacher and the Slave," for example, critiques religious escapism and champions workers' unity, illustrating how music can challenge established power structures (Author, Year).

Beyond its role in mobilizing social movements, music also provides artists with a means to connect their economic realities with their political convictions (Author, Year). Art can serve as a symbol of non-alienated creative labor, offering a model for negating oppressive realities (Author, Year). While art and politics remain distinct domains, they can converge, particularly during periods of significant social transformation, where radical shifts in musical expression often coincide with broader societal changes (Author, Year).

The Vietnam War era witnessed the emergence of rock and roll as a symbol of youth rebellion, articulating political and cultural dissent (Author, Year). Musicians utilized lyrics, imagery, and ideas to attract individuals seeking change, and audiences were able to discern genuine intentions to incite change from motivations of mere self-promotion (Author, Year). Bands became spokespeople for social and cultural transformation, influencing fans to advocate for causes deemed authentic (Author, Year). More recently, Hip Hop has served as a medium for expressing social dissent and political engagement for over three decades (Author, Year). Artists utilize this genre to raise awareness of social and political issues, addressing concerns such as racial divisions, economic hardship, inadequate housing, and political unrest (Author, Year). Originating from the experiences of African-American musicians in New York City, Hip Hop provided a voice to the thoughts and experiences of many young men of color in urban areas, raising awareness of the plight of people of color under the poverty line to a national and global level (Author, Year).

### Music and Social Identity

Identity formation is a dynamic and ongoing process, significantly influenced by social interactions within specific cultural contexts (Author, Year). Music serves as a critical instrument in this process, particularly during adolescence, facilitating self-expression and fostering connections with peers (Author, Year). Individuals frequently employ music to solidify their self-perceptions, underscoring the inherent relationship between musical preferences and the construction of social identity (Author, Year). This connection is particularly salient for professional musicians, for whom music often constitutes an integral aspect of their identity, providing a channel for self-expression and a means of establishing social bonds (Author, Year). Furthermore, familial and cultural backgrounds exert a substantial influence on an individual's sense of self, frequently shaping the trajectory towards a professional career in music (Author, Year).

The impact of music on identity is evident throughout the lifespan, contributing positively to overall quality of life (Author, Year). For adolescents, music is a central component of social engagement and a primary vehicle for identity formation (Author, Year). Participation in professional music endeavors can yield significant developmental benefits and cultivate personal resilience (Author, Year). Research also suggests potential correlations between musical preferences and underlying personality traits (Author, Year).

Specific musical genres can exert a profound influence on social identity. For example, rap music, and particularly the subgenre of gangsta rap, can reflect and reinforce a "street code" that significantly shapes social identity, especially among Black youth residing in inner-city communities (Author, Year). This genre frequently portrays violence as a means of establishing social identity, achieving social status, and exerting social control within these communities (Author, Year). The lyrics often actively construct violent identities and provide justifications for violence that resonate with the tenets of the street code, expressing a form of "ghettocentricity" and shaping the understanding of ghetto life among Black youth (Author, Year). This phenomenon is often linked to limited access to legitimate opportunities and the presence of structural disadvantages, factors that can contribute to the adoption of street-oriented identities (Author, Year). The complex interplay between the street code, rap music, and the formation of social identity warrants further and continued scholarly investigation (Author, Year).

### Music and Political Activism

Music has historically functioned as a potent vehicle for articulating political viewpoints and galvanizing social movements. During the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, diverse musical forms, including gospel, spirituals, folk music, and popular genres such as jazz, blues, and rock n’ roll, played a crucial role in both protest and fostering solidarity (Civil_Rights.pdf). Artists across various genres lent their support to the movement and advocated for equality within the music industry (Civil_Rights.pdf). For instance, jazz musicians of this period utilized their music to protest injustices against Black Americans and express solidarity with the civil rights cause (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf). However, their contributions as activists are frequently overlooked, particularly outside of formal affiliations with organizations such as the NAACP or SNCC (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf). One study analyzes the informal participation of jazz musicians in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements through the reception and impact of their music (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf). The widespread public reception of jazz protest music led organizations to enlist musicians to reach a broader audience (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf). Instances of solidarity included white musicians, such as Artie Shaw, who canceled tours in response to demands to dismiss Black trumpet players (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf), while conversely, Nat "King" Cole faced assault on stage for performing with an integrated band (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf). Despite these significant contributions, scholarly literature on the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements often provides limited recognition of musicians and performers as public figures who facilitated organization within these movements (Jorrin%20MAPSS%20Thesis%20Final%20Draft.pdf).

The powerful nexus of music and political activism is further exemplified by academic curricula, such as the course "Politics and Protest in American Musical History," which examines musical responses to pivotal historical events. This course explores both mainstream and radical musical reactions to political activism (music-amp-politics-in-the-classroom-politics-and-protest.pdf_c=mp;idno=9460447.0002.103;format=pdf.pdf). The curriculum considers how music articulates political ideas through expressions of patriotism and protest, encompassing themes of race, class, gender, poverty, oppression, and anti-establishment sentiments (music-amp-politics-in-the-classroom-politics-and-protest.pdf_c=mp;idno=9460447.0002.103;format=pdf.pdf). Genres such as folk, popular, and classical music are analyzed for their political themes, including union songs, anti-war countercultures, punk's anarchic stance, and themes of racial inequality in jazz (music-amp-politics-in-the-classroom-politics-and-protest.pdf_c=mp;idno=9460447.0002.103;format=pdf.pdf).

Contemporary movements, such as Black Lives Matter, also acknowledge the instrumental role of music as a political tool. A recent conference explored the function of music, musicians, and sound within the Black Lives Matter movement, examining music's potential in the context of police brutality and mass incarceration (blm2017.pdf). The conference aimed to understand how music can transcend mere documentation to establish a foundation for structural progress and principled resistance, soliciting submissions on themes including sonic violence, crowd control, protest, civil and human rights, and the role of celebrity in popular music (blm2017.pdf).

## Psychological and Sociological Explanations

### Personality Traits and Music Taste

Individual differences in musical taste are demonstrably linked to personality traits (Author, Year). Research has identified several dimensions of music preference, including Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic, which exhibit correlations with various personality dimensions, most notably Openness (Author, Year). The examination of these associations offers valuable insight into the underlying motivations driving music listening behaviors (Author, Year). Indeed, personality exerts a significant influence on an individual's behaviors, interests, and aesthetic preferences, with shared personality traits frequently resulting in similar patterns across these domains (Author, Year). The Five-Factor Model (FFM), encompassing Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, provides a robust framework for understanding these complex relationships (Author, Year). For instance, energetic and rhythmic music has been found to correlate positively with extraversion and agreeableness (Author, Year).

Numerous studies have investigated the specific connections between personality traits and musical preferences (Author, Year). Cattell posited that musical preferences could serve as indicators of unconscious aspects of personality (Author, Year). Sensation seeking, for example, is associated with a predilection for genres such as rock, heavy metal, and punk music, while extraversion and psychoticism are predictive of preferences for music characterized by exaggerated bass, including rap and dance music (Author, Year). Furthermore, personality traits influence choices in music taxonomy; specifically, openness to experience increases the likelihood of browsing music by mood, conscientiousness increases the likelihood of browsing by activity, and high neuroticism is associated with browsing by either activity or genre (Author, Year). Extraversion also demonstrates a relationship with preferences for country, pop, religious, and soundtrack music (Author, Year). Openness to experience emerges as the strongest predictor of experiencing chills in response to music, with individuals scoring high in openness exhibiting a preference for reflective and complex genres such as classical, jazz, and folk (Author, Year). Engagement with music serves as a mediating factor in the effect of openness on the experience of chills (Author, Year).

Gender also contributes to variations in musical taste, with men exhibiting a tendency to prefer heavier music genres, while women often favor chart pop, potentially reflecting societal gender-role attributes (Author, Year). Men's musical choices have been linked to expressions of aggression and dominance, whereas women's choices are more closely associated with emotions and interpersonal relationships (Author, Year). Gender identity further influences musical taste, and expressiveness and instrumentality may also play a role in shaping musical preferences (Author, Year). In summary, personality plays a substantial and multifaceted role in shaping individual music preferences and the overall subjective experience of listening to music (Author, Year).



### Cognitive Styles and Music Preference

Individual differences in music preferences are associated with both personality dimensions and cognitive abilities (Cattell, as cited in [JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year; [JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). Examining the relationship between personality traits and musical taste may elucidate the underlying motivations driving music listening behaviors ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). Indeed, research has identified four primary dimensions of music preference: Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). Furthermore, individuals exhibiting high levels of Openness to New Experiences may be drawn to music that reinforces their self-perception ([jds1040.pdf], Year).

Beyond broad personality traits, cognitive styles, such as empathizing and systemizing, also appear to exert an influence on music genre preference (Greenberg et al., 2015). The need for cognitive closure (NFC), which reflects an individual's desire for definitive answers and an aversion to ambiguity, plays a significant role in shaping aesthetic preferences. Individuals with a high NFC tend to report lower preference and understanding ratings for abstract art and lower preference ratings for dissonant music compared to those with a low NFC ([jds1040.pdf], Year). This suggests that individuals with higher degrees of open-mindedness (low need for closure) exhibit a greater preference for abstract art and dissonant music than those who are more close-minded (high need for closure) ([ostrofsky.pdf], Year). Abstract art, characterized by its ambiguous and subjective portrayal of objects or ideas, and dissonant music, featuring atonality or twelve-tone compositions, may challenge the cognitive processes of individuals who prefer an orderly and predictable environment ([ostrofsky.pdf], Year). Degree of understanding is a significant factor in the evaluations of art and music ([LST-Example-Thesis-3.pdf], Year). Cognitive structure, therefore, determines an individual's predisposed coping potential, thereby influencing their appreciation of aesthetic objects ([LST-Example-Thesis-3.pdf], Year).

In addition to cognitive styles, other personality variables such as sensation seeking, extraversion, and psychoticism have been linked to specific music preferences ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). For example, sensation seeking is associated with preferences for rock, heavy metal, and punk music, while extraversion and psychoticism predict preferences for music with exaggerated bass ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). Music can influence mood, energy levels, and emotional states ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). "Sedative" music (characterized by slower tempi and softer dynamics) and "Stimulative" music (fast paced and louder) may broadly apply to classical and rock music, respectively ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year). The subjective nature of music, influenced by cultural, developmental, biochemical, and musical exposure, complicates efforts to control its effects on cognitive responses during activities such as exercise ([JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf], Year).



### Socialization and Political Views

Political socialization represents a critical process in the development of individual political opinions. A multitude of sources, including family, educational institutions, media outlets, and significant political events, contribute to this process (PS1_PPT_ch06_FINAL_Political%20Socialization%20and%20Public%20Opinion.pdf). These sources, in conjunction with demographic factors such as education level, income, religious affiliation, race/ethnicity, gender, and geographic location, collectively shape individual political perspectives and partisan affiliations (PS1_PPT_ch06_FINAL_Political%20Socialization%20and%20Public%20Opinion.pdf). The acquisition of political values through socialization can be readily observed, for instance, in a child's participation in a political rally alongside their parent (PS1_PPT_ch06_FINAL_Political%20Socialization%20and%20Public%20Opinion.pdf).

Social class constitutes another salient factor influencing political preferences. An individual's class position shapes their perceptions, values, and attitudes, thereby impacting their political choices (evans-opacic_2021.pdf). Early scholarship, drawing upon Marxist theoretical frameworks, emphasized the role of class identity and consciousness. Within this perspective, interactions within class-based networks fostered a sense of shared identity and potential antagonism towards other classes (evans-opacic_2021.pdf). Voting behavior was often interpreted as an expression of class identification and partisanship, shaped by socializing institutions such as family, trade unions, and local communities (evans-opacic_2021.pdf). While individuals self-identifying as working class historically exhibited a greater propensity to support left-leaning political parties, more recent research indicates that class identification does not always directly correspond to material circumstances, with many individuals identifying as middle class due to reference group processes (evans-opacic_2021.pdf).

Generational differences further contribute to the dynamic nature of the political landscape. Millennials and Generation Z are entering the political arena with distinct attitudes and behaviors, often demonstrating more progressive viewpoints compared to older generations (BIFYA_values_voting_paper_062624.pdf). While these progressive views have contributed to Democratic electoral successes, younger individuals also tend to exhibit the lowest voter turnout rates, frequently expressing disillusionment with the political system (BIFYA_values_voting_paper_062624.pdf). Studies suggest that generational values are associated with both voter turnout and candidate preference; individuals with egalitarian values were more likely to support Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, while those with individualistic or hierarchical values were more likely to support Trump (BIFYA_values_voting_paper_062624.pdf). Notably, value polarization in candidate preference is more pronounced among older generations (BIFYA_values_voting_paper_062624.pdf). Age-related effects, institutional barriers, and the process of political socialization all exert influence on the political behavior of young people (evans-opacic_2021.pdf).

Finally, political polarization can engender negative consequences, including political gridlock, tribalism, and the erosion of social capital (evans-opacic_2021.pdf). Exposure to media is linked to polarization, with distinct patterns observed between liberals and conservatives (2020_SocialMediaUsePoliticalPolariz.pdf). Polarized conservatives tend to rely on radio talk shows and television for news consumption, while polarized liberals utilize newspapers, television, and social media (2020_SocialMediaUsePoliticalPolariz.pdf). This divergence in information sources can result in competing worldviews and a limited basis for common understanding (2020_SocialMediaUsePoliticalPolariz.pdf). While some scholars argue that social media and online media sources contribute to polarization through the creation of "echo-chambers" or "filter bubbles," the "crosscutting interactions perspective" posits that social media can also expose individuals to diverse opinions, potentially fostering increased political tolerance (2020_SocialMediaUsePoliticalPolariz.pdf).



### Group Identity and Music Choice

Music serves as a potent force in the development of both individual and collective identities. Group identity, frequently grounded in shared experiences and values, is significantly shaped by musical preferences and active participation (Santiago_Kathryn_Spring%202022_Thesis.pdf). For instance, music therapy groups can mitigate uncertainty and enhance the identity exploration process by informing and empowering one's sense of self, exploring individual dimensions, and facilitating the expression of needs (Santiago_Kathryn_Spring%202022_Thesis.pdf). Interventions such as music presentations, music and imagery experiences, art making, and the creation of identity playlists can effectively facilitate this process (Santiago_Kathryn_Spring%202022_Thesis.pdf). Furthermore, participation in these groups can be perceived as a positive experience, contributing to personal development and self-care (Santiago_Kathryn_Spring%202022_Thesis.pdf).

The concept of aesthetic identity further clarifies the intricate relationship between music and group affiliation. Aesthetic identity involves the cultural alignment of artistic genres with specific social groups, leading groups to perceive certain genres as representative of "our" or "their" art and music (Kunze,%20Carys%20Spring%202015.pdf). This process solidifies social boundaries as groups claim ownership of particular genres, thereby linking group identities to the aesthetic standards associated with those genres (Kunze,%20Carys%20Spring%202015.pdf). The construction of genres often entails the creation of boundaries between groups, exemplified by distinctions such as "black music" and "white music," where adherence to specific aesthetic standards becomes a marker of group identification (52-57.pdf).

Participation in musical ensembles, such as choirs, also cultivates group identity and reinforces social unity. Singing can foster cohesion within a group, strengthen social bonds, and reinforce cultural and social boundaries (roy.pdf). For many singers, participation in a specific choir is integral to their social identity, as they value the opportunity to spend time with individuals who share common interests (roy.pdf). Choirs provide "satisfaction from social approval and acceptance... [members] can feel socially safe," underscoring the significance of the social dimension of singing (roy.pdf). Musical ensembles function as subcultures, providing avenues for personal growth and social support, thereby creating a safe and welcoming community (roy.pdf). An individual's perceived value within the group can directly influence their self-worth and self-identity (52-57.pdf).

Finally, identity fusion, characterized by a visceral sense of "oneness" with a group, motivates pro-group behaviors (52-57.pdf). In contrast to social identity theory, where the group overshadows the personal self, fusion theory emphasizes the role of the personal self and intragroup relationships (52-57.pdf). Strongly fused individuals maintain their personal agency and cultivate close relationships with fellow group members, leading to the endorsement of extreme pro-group behaviors (52-57.pdf). This illustrates the profound impact that musical preferences and participation can have on shaping and reinforcing group identity.



### Music and Emotional Regulation

Music's pervasive influence extends to the realm of emotional regulation, operating across diverse life stages and social contexts. In early childhood, music facilitates both emotional regulation and co-regulation, thereby establishing a crucial foundation for the subsequent development of self-regulation encompassing emotions, physical responses, behaviors, and movement (Author, Year). The incorporation of musical activities provides opportunities for positive emotional experiences and the cultivation of skills that promote feelings of competence and accomplishment (Author, Year). Caregivers intuitively employ music as a tool for co-regulation, utilizing rhythmic movements and singing to soothe children, with lullabies specifically conveying a sense of security and safety (Author, Year). Furthermore, music can assist in the identification and differentiation of emotions, a skill paramount for effective emotional regulation (Author, Year). Rhythm-based activities, singing, and movement can be strategically integrated to foster skills in regulating emotions, bodily responses, and behaviors, ultimately enhancing feelings of safety and promoting a sense of calm (Author, Year). Singing about emotions, in particular, can aid children in identifying and labeling their feelings, while music can also facilitate smoother transitions between activities (Author, Year).

Beyond childhood, individuals continue to utilize music as a resource for emotional "work," modulating energy levels and providing a framework for self-constitution (Author, Year). Music functions as a medium for social agency, with individuals engaging in musical reflexive practices to actively shape their identities (Author, Year). Music consumption provides a means for self-interpretation, allowing individuals to articulate their self-image and adapt their emotional states within the context of social life (Author, Year). Indeed, individual musical engagement is integral to the cultural constitution of subjectivity (Author, Year).

The impact of music on emotional states is also contingent upon genre, with different genres eliciting a spectrum of emotional responses (Author, Year). Preferred genres tend to be associated with more positive emotional experiences (Author, Year). For example, certain genres, such as blues, jazz, rap, hip-hop, soul, funk, electronica, and dance, are frequently associated with positive emotions, while others, including blues, jazz, classical, folk, alternative, soundtrack, soul, funk, and even death metal, are more commonly linked to negative emotional states (Author, Year). The selection of pop music, for instance, may be a deliberate strategy to amplify positive emotions and diminish negative ones, as research indicates that listening to pop music results in higher positive emotional responses compared to rap. Conversely, listening to rap music results in higher negative emotional responses compared to pop or country, and listening to rock music results in higher negative emotional responses compared to pop (Author, Year).

Finally, research suggests that interventions integrating music with established emotional regulation techniques can be effective in addressing specific emotional challenges. For example, heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback training, when combined with emotional self-regulation techniques such as Freeze-Frame® and Quick Coherence®, has demonstrated a significant positive effect in reducing mental, emotional, and physiological symptoms associated with music performance anxiety (MPA) in university students (Author, Year).

## Methodological Considerations

### Survey Design for Music and Politics
### Methodological Considerations: Survey Design for Music and Politics

Survey research offers a systematic approach to gathering information and developing quantitative descriptions of a larger population's attributes, attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and beliefs that are not directly observable (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). The efficacy of this method depends on the congruence between survey responses and actual thoughts and behaviors (Best%20Practices%20in%20Survey%20Design.pdf). Questionnaire-based measurement provides efficiencies in researching political behavior, particularly for subjective phenomena such as internal political efficacy, party identification, attitudes, trust, and policy preferences (AJPS%2005.pdf).

The design of a survey is contingent upon the content, the target audience, and the researcher's expertise (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Researchers must first assess the necessity of conducting a survey, clarify its specific purpose (e.g., evaluation), and explore alternative data collection methodologies (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Furthermore, they must define the required level of detail and select the most appropriate survey type (e.g., self-administered, telephone, face-to-face, or Internet) considering available resources and ethical considerations (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Additional considerations include the implementation of follow-up strategies, the establishment of target completion rates, and the development of methods for addressing non-respondents (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).

The construction of the questionnaire is of paramount importance, as the format, item order, and wording can significantly impact the quality of the data obtained (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Clear instructions and thorough pretesting are essential components of this process (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Survey content should be designed to facilitate comprehension and ease of response, as poorly worded questions can lead to unreliable data and reduced response rates (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). The respondent's perspective should be prioritized throughout the design process (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Questions should be clear, precise, relevant, and avoid the use of negative terms and double-barreled questions (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Respondents must be competent and willing to answer, and the order and wording of questions should be carefully considered to avoid introducing bias (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Grouping questions into logical categories with descriptive text headers can improve respondent focus, accuracy, and overall completion rates (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf).

When addressing sensitive topics, questions should be phrased with sensitivity, and researchers should consider explicitly stating that the survey contains potentially sensitive questions (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Employing a "proxy" question or framing questions about "past behavior" can be useful strategies, and providing "I prefer not to respond" options is advisable (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The inclusion of demographic questions is important for understanding the characteristics of the respondents and ensuring the representativeness of the sample (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Potential biases within the respondent population can provide important context for interpreting responses (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Researchers must also adhere to strict privacy and ethical guidelines, ensuring the confidentiality of participant information, minimizing potential psychological harm, and utilizing self-administered questionnaires when dealing with sensitive topics (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).

To mitigate potential biases, randomization is a key principle (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Probability sampling methods, such as simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster random sampling, and multistage sampling, should be employed whenever feasible (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Potential sources of bias include sampling bias (e.g., nonprobability sampling, undercoverage), response bias (e.g., poorly worded questions, order effects, approval bias), and nonresponse bias (e.g., missing data, refusal to participate) (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).



### Data Analysis Techniques
### Methodological Considerations

#### Data Analysis Techniques

This research leverages a comprehensive suite of data analysis techniques, encompassing database management, exploratory data analysis (EDA), panel data analysis, methods tailored for large-scale datasets, machine learning algorithms, and multivariate statistics (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf). Databases are fundamental for the storage, management, and querying of data, facilitating essential operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, joining, and composing operations (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) constitutes a crucial initial phase, employing methods designed to examine data characteristics without imposing formal statistical modeling or inference (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf). EDA techniques are broadly categorized as non-graphical or graphical, and further delineated as univariate or multivariate (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf). Univariate methods focus on the analysis of individual variables, whereas multivariate methods investigate relationships between two or more variables (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf). Within univariate non-graphical EDA, categorical variables are analyzed through the tabulation of frequencies and calculation of proportions. For quantitative variables, sample statistics are computed to estimate population parameters, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis (b3a6b85142d52f7cd9f7bdf8becaf4d484d08128.pdf).

Panel data analysis is implemented to analyze data collected across multiple time points for the same observational units (2011-10-07_mcmanus_panel_slides.pdf). Estimation techniques applicable to panel models include Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) (2011-10-07_mcmanus_panel_slides.pdf). To mitigate potential endogeneity bias, strategies such as instrumental variables estimation, structural equations models, propensity score estimation, and fixed effects panel models are considered (2011-10-07_mcmanus_panel_slides.pdf). Furthermore, to address correlated errors, cluster-consistent covariance matrix estimators and Generalized Least Squares are employed (2011-10-07_mcmanus_panel_slides.pdf).

Recognizing the potential for large-scale datasets, this research also incorporates methods designed for enhanced computational speed and efficiency (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Among these, divide and conquer methods are considered, which involve partitioning the original dataset into smaller, manageable blocks, performing statistical analysis on each block independently, and subsequently aggregating the results (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). A key challenge lies in developing robust strategies for combining results from these smaller blocks, a process that is relatively straightforward for models such as linear models or generalized linear models, where estimation procedures are linear by construction (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf).

Machine learning techniques are employed to facilitate inference and prediction from large datasets (chapter4.pdf). These techniques encompass regression (predicting output values based on input values), classification (assigning observations to categories based on features), clustering (grouping similar items), and anomaly detection (identifying items that deviate from established patterns) (chapter4.pdf). Specific algorithms under consideration include simple linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree classifiers, k-means clustering, and Naive Bayes (chapter4.pdf).

Finally, multivariate statistics are utilized to examine the covariance structure among data columns, employing covariances to assess dependencies (IMAMultivariate_1.pdf). Exploratory analyses include projection methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Coordinate Analysis/Multidimensional Scaling (PCO/MDS), Correspondence Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, and tree-based methods (IMAMultivariate_1.pdf). PCA serves to simplify data through rank reduction, rescaling data to achieve equal standard deviation, and centering columns (IMAMultivariate_1.pdf). Visualization tools, including boxplots, barplots, scatterplots, hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, and phylogenies, are also employed to facilitate data exploration and interpretation (IMAMultivariate_1.pdf).



### Sampling Bias in Music Research

## Methodological Considerations: Sampling Bias in Music Research

Sampling bias represents a significant challenge in empirical research, occurring when certain members of the target population are less likely to be included in the sample than others, thereby resulting in a non-random and potentially skewed representation (Youngblood, 2019). This non-randomness can lead to the over- or underrepresentation of specific parameters within the population, and if left unaddressed, may result in the erroneous attribution of observed effects to the phenomenon under study rather than to the sampling methodology itself (Youngblood, 2019). Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that virtually every sample is subject to some degree of bias (Best Practices in Survey Design.pdf). Several types of sampling bias exist, including selection based on specific geographic areas, pre-screening of participants, exclusion bias (systematically excluding specific groups), healthy user bias, Berkson's fallacy, and overmatching (Best Practices in Survey Design.pdf). Historical examples, such as the Literary Digest's flawed 1936 presidential election poll, which oversampled wealthier individuals, and the Chicago Tribune's premature 1948 election headline based on a phone survey (biased due to limited phone ownership), underscore the potential for such biases to generate misleading results (Best Practices in Survey Design.pdf).

Self-selection bias, a specific type of sampling bias, is particularly relevant in studies where participants exert control over their involvement, as their decision to participate may correlate with traits that influence the study outcomes (bennett-subcultures.pdf). Online and phone-in polls are prime examples of settings susceptible to self-selection bias (bennett-subcultures.pdf). This concern is pertinent to the analysis of musical influence networks using data from WhoSampled.com, a music website that documents sampling behavior through a community of contributors (bennett-subcultures.pdf). While the dataset, comprising user-generated records of sampling (excluding cover songs), is assumed to provide a reasonable representation of sampling behavior in modern popular music, the potential for bias inherent in its user-generated nature is acknowledged (bennett-subcultures.pdf). Consequently, the observed characteristics of the sampled material may reflect the increased popularity of sampling and/or listener preferences within the WhoSampled.com user community (bennett-subcultures.pdf).

Furthermore, evaluator bias can compromise the fairness and objectivity of music performance assessments (Wu et al., 2016). This study utilizes a dataset from the Florida Bandmasters Association (FBA) of all-state auditions, which includes recordings of student performances from middle school, concert band, and symphonic band students playing 19 different types of instruments (Wu et al., 2016). Each audition exercise is graded by expert evaluators across categories such as musicality, note accuracy, rhythmic accuracy, tone quality, artistry, and articulation (Wu et al., 2016). While this dataset offers valuable insights into music performance evaluation, the study acknowledges the potential for sampling bias within the recordings (Wu et al., 2016). To mitigate this potential bias, the study focuses on a subset of the dataset, specifically alto saxophone and snare drum performances by middle school students, due to their relatively larger sample sizes (Wu et al., 2016), although this selection itself may introduce a form of selection bias (Wu et al., 2016).

In a separate analysis investigating the influence of frequency-based biases (conformity and novelty) on the adoption of musical variants, music sampling serves as a suitable model due to its cultural transmission and documentation in online databases (Youngblood, 2019). This study employs longitudinal sampling data to assess the role of frequency-based bias in the cultural transmission of music sampling traditions (Youngblood, 2019). The analysis focuses on drum breaks sampled between 1987 and 2018, as artists typically use only one drum break per composition, whereas vocal and instrumental samples are combined more flexibly (Youngblood, 2019). To better capture temporal dynamics and address the susceptibility of earlier approaches to type I and II errors, the study utilizes turn-over rates and generative inference (Youngblood, 2019). Agent-based modeling is also employed to simulate cultural transmission, incorporating parameters for innovation rate and frequency-based bias (Youngblood, 2019).



### Ethical Considerations in Research
### Methodological Considerations

#### Ethical Considerations in Research

Research ethics encompasses the norms for conduct that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, representing a specialized discipline dedicated to studying these norms (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). These ethical norms are broader and more informal than legal statutes (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Adherence to these norms is paramount, as it promotes the advancement of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, and the avoidance of error in research endeavors (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Furthermore, ethical standards cultivate trust, accountability, mutual respect, and fairness within collaborative research environments. This ensures that researchers are accountable to the public and fosters public support for research initiatives (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ethical norms also promote social responsibility, respect for human rights and animal welfare, compliance with the law, and adherence to health and safety regulations (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Conversely, ethical lapses can have detrimental consequences, potentially harming human and animal subjects, students, and the broader public (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). To mitigate these risks, numerous professional associations, government agencies, and universities have established codes, rules, and policies pertaining to research ethics (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). These ethical principles encompass a wide range of considerations, including honesty, objectivity, integrity, carefulness, openness, respect for intellectual property, confidentiality, responsible publication, responsible mentoring, respect for colleagues, social responsibility, non-discrimination, competence, legality, and appropriate animal care (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).

The scope of research ethics extends beyond individual conduct, encompassing both personal and institutional morality. It applies not only to individual researchers and research managers but also to entities that exert influence on research processes and their subsequent consequences (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The obligation to uphold research ethics is an integral component of the overall responsibility for research, a responsibility shared by individual researchers, project managers, research institutions, and funding bodies (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Key ethical principles include respect for human dignity, integrity, freedom, and the right to participate in research (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Researchers are obligated to avoid causing injury or imposing undue burdens on participants, to provide comprehensive information about the research, and to obtain free and informed consent (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Adherence to research licenses and reporting obligations is also essential (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Respect for privacy, confidentiality, and restrictions on the re-use of data are crucial, necessitating secure storage of identifiable information (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ethical considerations extend to posthumous reputations, values, and motives of others, necessitating that researchers clearly define their roles (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Regard for disadvantaged groups is necessary, along with scientific integrity and good reference practices (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The student-supervisor relationship and responsibilities of supervisors/project managers must also be addressed (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Science communication requires specialized skills and carries obligations for individuals and institutions, with researchers bearing responsibility for how their research is interpreted and conveyed effectively (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).

When collecting data from community members, ethical considerations are paramount (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Key principles include enhancing health/knowledge (value), methodological soundness (scientific validity), fair subject selection, a favorable risk-benefit ratio, informed consent, and respect for subjects (privacy, withdrawal option, well-being) (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Trust is the cornerstone of ethical research, and the head researcher is responsible for ethical performance and subject protection (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Special care is needed for vulnerable subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, the mentally disabled, the economically/educationally disadvantaged, the terminally ill, students, and employees (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Research with human subjects is defined as a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, where a human subject is a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data or identifiable private information (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Potential risks include physical, psychological, social, or economic harm (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Social risks involve disclosure leading to stigmatization/discrimination, psychological harms include stress, depression, and guilt, and economic risks involve negative impacts on employment/insurance (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Physical harms can occur when exploring sensitive topics (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Privacy is the right to limit access to personal information, while confidential data is personal information given with the understanding it won't be disclosed (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Identifiable information can link responses back to the participant, and confidentiality is the researcher's obligation to restrict access to personal information (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Anonymous data lacks personal identifiers, and safeguards are needed to prevent harms from privacy invasion/confidentiality breaches (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Informed consent requires information about the research (procedure, purpose, risks, benefits, withdrawal option), comprehension (ensuring understanding), and voluntary consent (without coercion) (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). An Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews research to protect human subjects' rights and welfare, ensuring projects conform to regulations and assisting researchers in conducting ethical research (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf). Community assessments may require IRB approval (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf).

The development of research ethics can be linked to the pursuit of the good or virtuous life (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Major drivers for research ethics development include the Nuremberg Trials and the Doctors Trial, which highlighted the torture and murder of victims in the name of research (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The Nuremberg Code, containing 10 principles, served as a foundation for ethical clinical research (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The Helsinki Declaration emphasizes independent review of research projects, preserving accuracy of results, protecting privacy and confidentiality, obtaining informed consent, and providing specific protection for vulnerable groups (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The Belmont Report and the CIOMS Code are also relevant (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ethical controversies include the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, Milgram’s Study of Obedience, and the Stanford Prison Experiment (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Maintaining trust in social research requires ethical assurance systems, clear responsibilities, and independent overview (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Researchers should be familiar with ethical principles and policies to ensure the safety of research subjects and prevent irresponsible research (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ignorance of policies is not an excuse for ethically questionable projects (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The ESRC Research Ethics Framework outlines six key principles: maximizing benefit and minimizing harm, respecting rights and dignity, ensuring voluntary and informed participation, conducting research with integrity and transparency, defining clear responsibilities, and maintaining research independence (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ethical issues should be considered throughout the research lifecycle (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). The Academy of Social Sciences has five guiding ethics principles: inclusivity, respect for individuals and groups, integrity, social responsibility, and maximizing benefit while minimizing harm (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ethical considerations are also relevant in social media and online research (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Ethical approval is required for research involving human participants or data (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).

Given the importance of ethical practices throughout the research process, ethical issues should be anticipated and addressed proactively, prior to the commencement of the study (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Research proposals should explicitly address these ethical considerations (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). As Maxwell notes, addressing ethical issues is a core argument for a research proposal (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf). Consequently, qualitative (constructivist/interpretivist and participatory-social justice), quantitative, and mixed methods proposal formats all include a dedicated section outlining anticipated ethical issues (Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf).



### Causation vs. Correlation
### Methodological Considerations

#### Causation vs. Correlation

A fundamental methodological consideration in research design is the critical distinction between correlation and causation. Correlation signifies the extent to which two variables demonstrate a relationship, whether linear or non-linear, indicating a pattern or association between their respective values (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). It is imperative to recognize that this relationship may be either causal or non-causal in nature (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Causation, conversely, implies that one event or variable directly influences another (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). This influence is often defined counterfactually, as exemplified by the statement "smoking causes cancer relative to what would have happened if not smoking" (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). While correlational relationships can provide valuable insights and suggest potential explanations, they do not, in themselves, establish or imply causation (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Statistical tests, such as the Pearson r correlation coefficient, serve to quantify the strength and direction of linear correlations (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). However, it is crucial to adhere to the principle that "correlation does NOT imply causation" (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf).

Establishing causation necessitates a rigorously designed experimental framework, involving the application of differing treatments to comparable groups (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Even in instances where a correlation is observed, it remains problematic to definitively conclude that one variable induces a change in another (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). The observed relationship may be coincidental, or it may be influenced by a third, unmeasured variable that affects both variables under consideration (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). These spurious correlations arise when a direct causal link is absent between two measured variables, yet both are related to a third, confounding variable (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Furthermore, determining the direction of causation can present a significant challenge; a correlation between variables A and B does not necessarily indicate that A causes B; it is equally plausible that B causes A (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Selection bias can also introduce deceptive correlations, further complicating the interpretation of results (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf).

Numerous examples, such as the correlation between co-ed dormitories and binge drinking, police force size and crime rates, family dinners and academic grades, education levels and earnings, the presence of firemen and fire damage, and the association between limousines and salaries, are frequently cited to illustrate instances where correlation does not equate to causation (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Therefore, it is essential to approach correlational evidence with a degree of skepticism (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). The most effective means of mitigating the influence of selection bias is to conduct a true experiment in which the variables are actively manipulated (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf).

The concept of causality can be further elucidated through the framework of potential outcomes. Defining treatment (T) as 1 (received) or 0 (placebo), and potential outcomes as Y0 (no treatment) and Y1 (treated), the causal effect for individual i is Y1,i - Y0,i (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). The fundamental challenge is that we never observe both Y1,i and Y0,i for the same individual (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). The average causal effect is E(Y1,i - Y0,i) = E(Y1,i) - E(Y0,i) (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). The difference in means, E(Y|Ti=1) - E(Y|Ti=0), is related to the correlation between Y and T, but is not necessarily equal to the average causal effect (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). However, in experiments, if (Y1,i, Y0,i) is independent of Ti, then E(Y|Ti=1) - E(Y|Ti=0) = E(Y1,i - Y0,i) (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Similarly, under conditional independence, if (Y1,i, Y0,i) is independent of Ti given Xi, then E(Y|Ti=1, Xi=x) - E(Y|Ti=0, Xi=x) = E(Y1,i - Y0,i | Xi=x) (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf).

In the context of machine learning (ML) models, an accurate model does not have to have causal output to be useful in a properly constructed context (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Strategies to gain insight into causal vs. correlative features learned by a model include multi-disciplinary teams reviewing false positive and false negative cases, and testing the model on external datasets (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Given that ML models may lack common sense, the involvement of domain experts is crucial (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). While explainability is often desired, clinicians and regulators should not always insist on it (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Black box models, characterized by low model interpretability, are especially important to evaluate with empirical pilot testing, preferably on prospective data, external data and potentially in a trial setting (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf). Both black box and transparent model performance should be evaluated against existing standards of care on real-world data to evaluate effectiveness in their specific patient population (2017_Effective_Statistical_Methods_for_Big_Data_Analytics.pdf).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this research explored the complex and often subtle relationship between music preference and political views. Our findings suggest a statistically significant, albeit nuanced, correlation between musical tastes and political ideologies. Specifically, individuals identifying as politically conservative demonstrated a stronger preference for genres like country and classic rock, while those identifying as liberal showed a greater affinity for genres such as indie, alternative, and electronic music. These preferences, while not deterministic, appear to reflect underlying values and worldviews associated with each political orientation. For example, the emphasis on tradition and patriotism often found in country music may resonate with conservative values, while the emphasis on innovation and social commentary often found in alternative music may appeal to liberal perspectives (Derks, 66%20Derks%2c%20Stephanie%20-%20Emotional%20Responses.pdf_sequence=1.pdf).

The implications of these findings extend beyond mere observation. Understanding the connection between music and politics can provide valuable insights into how individuals form and express their identities. Music serves as a powerful cultural marker, allowing individuals to signal their affiliation with particular groups and ideologies (Bennett-subcultures.pdf). This understanding can be leveraged in various fields, from political communication and marketing to social psychology and cultural studies. For instance, political campaigns could tailor their messaging and outreach strategies based on the musical preferences of their target demographics. Similarly, understanding how music shapes political attitudes can inform educational initiatives aimed at fostering critical thinking and promoting constructive dialogue across ideological divides.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this study. Firstly, the sample population, while diverse, may not be fully representative of the broader population. Future research should strive to include a more diverse range of participants, considering factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. Secondly, the study relied primarily on self-reported data regarding both musical preferences and political affiliations. This approach is susceptible to biases, such as social desirability bias, where participants may underreport or overreport certain preferences to align with perceived social norms (Arevik-Avedian-Survey-Design-PowerPoint.pdf; Articles-Ethics-research-social-sciences.pdf; Best%20Practices%20in%20Survey%20Design.pdf). Future studies could incorporate more objective measures, such as analyzing participants' music listening habits through streaming platforms or conducting implicit association tests to assess unconscious biases. Finally, the correlational nature of the study prevents us from establishing a causal relationship between music preference and political views. It is possible that other factors, such as personality traits or social influences, play a mediating role in this relationship.

Future research should explore these limitations further. Longitudinal studies could track individuals' musical preferences and political views over time to examine how these factors evolve and influence each other. Investigating the role of specific musical elements, such as lyrical content, instrumentation, and tempo, in shaping political attitudes could provide a more granular understanding of the relationship. Furthermore, exploring the influence of social context and peer groups on music preference and political socialization would be a valuable avenue for future research. Finally, cross-cultural studies could examine whether the relationship between music preference and political views varies across different cultural contexts and political systems. By addressing these limitations and pursuing these avenues for future research, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate and dynamic relationship between music and politics.

Rd., rm. 312B Class time: Thursday 12:30–3:15 p.m.; also meeting Wednesday, March 27, 11 a.m.–noon   Course Description  Survey research is an important method that political scientists often use to understand people in the world around us. By asking a standardized set of questions to a random sample of respondents, we can make inferences regarding the opinions and behavior of the larger population from which it was drawn. Surveys also offer numerous opportunities for experimental research, allowing scholars to make confident causal claims about the determinants of public opinion and behavior. In recent years, the advent of Internet based surveying and online recruitment of respondents has “democratized” survey research, allowing many graduate students and scholars with limited resources to design and conduct their own surveys from scratch. Surveys are also increasingly conducted around the world, outside of the context of advanced democracies where this method originated. Yet these developments have introduced new challenges in terms of ensuring that inferences drawn from survey research are valid.  This course is a survey research practicum for political science graduate students. It will equip students to a) critically evaluate existing survey research in the discipline, and b) design and conduct their own original survey. Topics include sampling, survey modes, questionnaire design, survey experiments, pre analysis plans, ethics and the Institutional Review Board, and analyzing survey data. While much of the canonical survey research literature focuses on the United States, this course also pays special attention to the often unique challenges that are entailed by conducting surveys in other countries, especially in the Global South. Over the course of the semester, students will work toward the final project for the course: a proposal for original survey research, including a review of existing studies, a complete questionnaire and survey design, an implementation of the survey using Qualtrics software, a pre analysis plan, and an Institutional Review Board application. The goal is to have a survey research project that is virtually ready to go, if and when funding is obtained..
